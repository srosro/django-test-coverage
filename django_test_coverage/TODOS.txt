Tests
-----

Write tests for the helper methods.

Improvements
-----

There might be a better way to get all modules from a django app and I do it way to complicated, but it works and for the moment that is all I need.

Possibility to write coverage report to a file if running the test with 'nohup' isn't good enough.
